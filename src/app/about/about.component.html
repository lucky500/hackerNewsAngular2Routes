<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
  Hacker News is a social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship. It is run by Paul Graham's investment fund and startup incubator, Y Combinator. In general, content that can be submitted is defined as "anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity".

  The intention was to recreate a community similar to the early days of Reddit.[2][7] However unlike Reddit where new users can immediately both up-vote and down-vote content, Hacker News does not allow users to down-vote content until they have accumulated 500 "karma" points. Karma points are calculated as the number of upvotes a given user's content has received minus the number of downvotes.[2] Regardless of karma, all users have the option to flag submitted content as spam.
